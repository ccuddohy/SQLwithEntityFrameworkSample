# SQLwithEntityFrameworkSample

This is from a Microsoft getting started tutorial. I did the first part of the tutorial in project SqlSample.
This part is using EntityFramework.

#### Goal
Use a very simple implementation of SQL server and Entity Framework. There is not much documentation on
the what and why in the tutorial but this project is nice for its simplicity.
